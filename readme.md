# Web Development With Jade

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slang800/jade-book/master/assets/img/cover.png)

## The Book
I wrote this book to provide a solid source of documentation for people
looking to learn how to use Jade and ended up publishing it as a "real book"
via Packt Publishing. You can buy it [here](http://www.packtpub.com/create-
dynamic-web-pages-using-jade/book)

## The Source
The whole book is written in Markdown, and (of course) a little Jade to hold
it together. Each chapter has a file in `/views` (`_ch1.md` to `_ch9.md`). If
you want to modify the book, you can use [roots](http://roots.cx) to compile
it:

```bash
npm install roots -g
git clone https://github.com/slang800/jade-book.git
cd jade-book
roots watch
```

...and a browser window should open for you automatically
